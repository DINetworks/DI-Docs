## Using Contract Addresses

### In JavaScript/TypeScript

```javascript
import { getContractAddress } from '@dinetwork/contracts';

// Get contract address for current network
const diTokenAddress = getContractAddress('DI_TOKEN', chainId);
const dusdAddress = getContractAddress('DUSD_TOKEN', chainId);

// Or use the addresses directly
const addresses = {
  1: { // Ethereum
    DI_TOKEN: '0x...',
    DUSD_TOKEN: '0x...',
    DSWAP: '0x...',
    DPERP: '0x...'
  },
  56: { // BSC
    DI_TOKEN: '0x...',
    DUSD_TOKEN: '0x...',
    DSWAP: '0x...',
    DPERP: '0x...'
  }
};
```

### In Solidity

```solidity
// Interface imports
import "@dinetwork/contracts/interfaces/IDIToken.sol";
import "@dinetwork/contracts/interfaces/IDUSD.sol";

contract MyContract {
    IDIToken public constant DI_TOKEN = IDIToken(0x...);
    IDUSD public constant DUSD_TOKEN = IDUSD(0x...);
    
    function interact() external {
        uint256 balance = DI_TOKEN.balanceOf(msg.sender);
        // ... contract logic
    }
}
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# .env file
REACT_APP_DI_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x...
REACT_APP_DUSD_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x...
REACT_APP_DSWAP_ADDRESS=0x...
REACT_APP_DPERP_ADDRESS=0x...
```

## Security Notes

### Address Verification

Always verify contract addresses through multiple sources:

1. **Official Documentation**: This page and official docs
2. **GitHub Repository**: Check the official repository
3. **Block Explorers**: Verify on Etherscan, BscScan, etc.
4. **Community Channels**: Ask in official Discord/Telegram

### Common Scams

Be aware of these common scams:

- **Fake Contracts**: Scammers deploy contracts with similar names
- **Phishing Sites**: Fake websites with wrong addresses
- **Social Media**: Fake accounts posting wrong addresses
- **Telegram/Discord**: Scammers impersonating team members

### Best Practices

1. **Bookmark Official Sites**: Save official URLs
2. **Double-Check Addresses**: Always verify before transactions
3. **Use Official Links**: Only use addresses from official sources
4. **Start Small**: Test with small amounts first
5. **Community Verification**: Ask in official channels if unsure

## Updates and Changes
