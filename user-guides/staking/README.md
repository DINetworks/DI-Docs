- Governance for DI token staking
- Liquidity for LP token staking

### Step 2: Connect and Approve
```
1. Connect wallet
2. Select staking amount
3. Choose lock period (if applicable)
4. Approve token spending
5. Confirm staking transaction
```

### Step 3: Monitor Performance
Track your staking rewards:
- Daily reward accrual
- Total staked amount
- Current APY
- Lock period remaining
- Claimable rewards

## Reward Mechanisms

### Automatic Compounding
Most staking rewards auto-compound:
```
Initial Stake: 1000 DUSD
Daily Reward: 0.5 DUSD (18% APY)
After 30 days: 1015.23 DUSD (compounded)
Manual Claim: 1015 DUSD (simple interest)
```

### Reward Sources
**DUSD Staking Rewards**:
- Liquidation bonuses (variable)
- Protocol fees (stable)
- Collateral gains (bonus)

**DI Governance Rewards**:
- Fee revenue sharing (60% of protocol fees)
- Governance participation bonuses
- Voting incentives

### Claiming Rewards
Options for reward management:
1. **Auto-Compound**: Reinvest rewards automatically
2. **Manual Claim**: Claim rewards to wallet
3. **Partial Claim**: Claim portion, compound remainder

## Lock Periods and Multipliers

### DI Governance Staking
| Lock Period | APY Multiplier | Voting Power | Early Exit |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|------------|
| **No Lock** | 1.0x | 1.0x | Anytime |
| **3 Months** | 1.2x | 1.1x | 50% penalty |
| **6 Months** | 1.5x | 1.2x | 50% penalty |
| **12 Months** | 2.0x | 1.5x | 50% penalty |
| **24 Months** | 2.5x | 2.0x | 50% penalty |

### Lock Period Strategy
**Short-term (0-3 months)**:
- Maintain liquidity
- Lower rewards but flexible
- Good for market uncertainty

**Medium-term (6-12 months)**:
- Balanced approach
- Decent reward multipliers
- Moderate commitment

**Long-term (12-24 months)**:
- Maximum rewards
- Strong governance power
- High commitment required

## Risk Management

### Staking Risks
**Smart Contract Risk**:
- Protocol bugs or exploits
- Mitigation: Start with small amounts

**Liquidation Risk** (DUSD staking):
- Pool absorbs bad debt during liquidations
- Mitigation: Diversify across staking types

**Lock-up Risk**:
- Tokens locked for chosen period
- Mitigation: Only lock funds you don't need

**Impermanent Loss** (LP staking):
- Price divergence between paired assets
- Mitigation: Choose stable pairs or hedge

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
1. **Diversification**: Spread across multiple staking types
2. **Gradual Entry**: Start small and increase over time
3. **Emergency Fund**: Keep liquid reserves
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Check performance and risks

## Performance Tracking

### Key Metrics to Monitor
```
Staking Dashboard:
- Total Staked Value: $10,000
- Current APY: 18.5%
- Daily Rewards: $5.07
- Total Rewards Earned: $1,250
- Time Staked: 90 days
- Effective APY: 19.2% (including compounds)
```

### Performance Analysis
**Return Calculation**:
```
Initial Investment: $10,000
Current Value: $11,250
Time Period: 90 days
Annualized Return: ((11,250/10,000)^(365/90) - 1) × 100 = 22.8%
```

**Benchmark Comparison**:
- Compare against traditional savings (2-3%)
- Compare against DeFi alternatives
- Factor in risk-adjusted returns

## Tax Considerations

### Staking Rewards Taxation
**General Guidelines** (consult tax professional):
- Rewards typically taxable as income when received
- Value based on fair market value at receipt
- Different rules for different jurisdictions

### Record Keeping
Track for tax purposes:
- Staking start/end dates
- Reward amounts and dates
- Token prices at reward time
- Transaction hashes for verification

### Tax Optimization
- Consider timing of reward claims
- Understand local tax implications
- Use crypto tax software for tracking
- Consult with tax professionals

## Advanced Staking Strategies

### Yield Farming Rotation
Move between highest-yielding opportunities:
1. Monitor APY changes across platforms
2. Calculate switching costs (gas, fees)
3. Move capital when profitable
4. Maintain some stable positions

### Governance Participation
Maximize governance rewards:
- Vote on all proposals
- Delegate to active participants
- Create valuable proposals
- Engage in community discussions

### Cross-Chain Optimization
Leverage multiple chains:
- Compare yields across chains
- Consider bridge costs and risks
- Diversify chain exposure
- Monitor chain-specific risks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
**Rewards Not Showing**:
- Check if rewards have vested
- Verify staking transaction confirmed
- Refresh interface or try different browser

**Cannot Unstake**:
- Check if lock period has ended
- Verify you have gas for transaction
- Check for any protocol restrictions

**Lower Than Expected APY**:
- APY is variable and changes over time
- Check if there are performance fees
- Verify you're in the correct staking pool
