4. **Confirm Transaction**: Approve and execute staking

## Lock Periods and Rewards

### Lock Period Options
| Duration | APY Multiplier | Voting Power | Governance Boost |
|----------|----------------|--------------|------------------|
| **No Lock** | 1.0x (8% base) | 1.0x | None |
| **3 Months** | 1.2x (9.6%) | 1.1x | +10% |
| **6 Months** | 1.5x (12%) | 1.2x | +20% |
| **12 Months** | 2.0x (16%) | 1.5x | +50% |
| **24 Months** | 2.5x (20%) | 2.0x | +100% |

### Choosing Lock Period
**No Lock (Flexible)**:
- Pros: Complete flexibility, no commitment
- Cons: Lowest rewards, minimal governance power
- Best for: Short-term holders, uncertain market conditions

**3-6 Months (Moderate)**:
- Pros: Decent rewards, moderate commitment
- Cons: Still limited governance power
- Best for: Balanced approach, testing the waters

**12-24 Months (Maximum)**:
- Pros: Highest rewards, maximum governance power
- Cons: Long commitment, early exit penalties
- Best for: Long-term believers, governance participants

## Reward Calculation

### Base Reward Formula
```
Annual Rewards = Staked Amount × Base APY × Lock Multiplier × Governance Multiplier

Example:
Staked: 10,000 DI
Base APY: 8%
Lock Multiplier: 2.0x (12 months)
Governance Multiplier: 1.2x (active voter)
Annual Rewards: 10,000 × 0.08 × 2.0 × 1.2 = 1,920 DI
```

### Daily Reward Accrual
```
Daily Rewards = Annual Rewards ÷ 365

From example above:
Daily Rewards = 1,920 ÷ 365 = 5.26 DI per day
```

### Compound Growth
With auto-compounding enabled:
```
Year 1: 10,000 → 11,920 DI
Year 2: 11,920 → 14,208 DI
Year 3: 14,208 → 16,928 DI
```

## Governance Benefits

### Enhanced Voting Power
Staked DI tokens receive voting multipliers:
```
Base Voting Power: 1 DI = 1 vote
3-month lock: 1 DI = 1.1 votes
6-month lock: 1 DI = 1.2 votes
12-month lock: 1 DI = 1.5 votes
24-month lock: 1 DI = 2.0 votes
```

### Governance Participation Rewards
**Voting Bonuses**:
- +10% APY for voting on >80% of proposals
- +5% APY for voting on 50-80% of proposals
- No bonus for <50% participation

**Proposal Rewards**:
- 1,000 DI bonus for successful proposals
- 500 DI bonus for proposals reaching quorum
- Recognition in community leaderboards

**Delegation Rewards**:
- Earn 5% of delegator rewards when others delegate to you
- Build reputation as trusted governance participant

- **Emergency Exit**: Early unstaking with penalties

## Reward Management

### Auto-Compounding
**Benefits**:
- Maximizes compound growth
- No gas costs for reinvestment
- Set-and-forget approach
- Higher long-term returns

**How it works**:
```
Every 24 hours:
1. Calculate accrued rewards
2. Automatically restake rewards
3. Update total staked amount
4. Continue earning on larger base
```

### Manual Claiming
**When to claim**:
- Need liquidity for other opportunities
- Want to diversify into other assets
- Approaching tax year-end
- Taking profits systematically

**Claiming process**:
1. Navigate to staking dashboard
2. Click "Claim Rewards"
3. Confirm transaction
4. Rewards sent to wallet

### Partial Claiming
Claim portion of rewards while compounding the rest:
```
Total Rewards: 100 DI
Claim: 30 DI (for expenses)
Compound: 70 DI (continue growing)
```

## Early Exit and Penalties

### Early Unstaking
If you need to exit before lock period ends:
- **Penalty**: 50% of accrued rewards forfeited
- **Principal**: Always returned in full
- **Process**: Immediate after penalty payment

### Penalty Calculation
```
Example Early Exit:
Staked: 10,000 DI
Accrued Rewards: 800 DI
Penalty: 400 DI (50% of rewards)
You Receive: 10,400 DI (principal + 400 DI)
Forfeited: 400 DI (goes to remaining stakers)
```

### Emergency Situations
Governance can enable penalty-free exits during:
- Protocol emergencies
- Major security issues
- Significant protocol changes
- Community-voted exceptions

## Staking Strategies

### Conservative Strategy
**Profile**: Risk-averse, steady income
- **Lock Period**: 3-6 months
- **Amount**: 25-50% of DI holdings
- **Management**: Auto-compound, minimal governance
- **Expected APY**: 9.6-12%

### Balanced Strategy
**Profile**: Moderate risk, active participation
- **Lock Period**: 12 months
- **Amount**: 50-75% of DI holdings
- **Management**: Mix of claiming and compounding
- **Governance**: Active voting, occasional proposals
- **Expected APY**: 16-20%

### Aggressive Strategy
**Profile**: Maximum commitment, governance leader
- **Lock Period**: 24 months
- **Amount**: 75-90% of DI holdings
- **Management**: Full auto-compound
- **Governance**: Very active, proposal creation, delegation
- **Expected APY**: 20-25%

## Tax Considerations

### Staking Rewards Taxation
**Income Recognition**:
- Rewards taxable when earned (not claimed)
- Fair market value at time of earning
- Daily accrual creates daily taxable events

**Record Keeping**:
Track for each reward period:
- Date of reward accrual
- Amount of DI earned
- USD value at time of earning
- Cumulative rewards for year

### Tax Optimization Strategies
**Timing Claims**:
- Claim in low-income years
- Spread claims across tax years
- Consider tax-loss harvesting

**Jurisdiction Considerations**:
- Different countries have different rules
- Some treat staking as mining income
- Others treat as capital gains
- Consult local tax professionals

## Performance Tracking

### Key Metrics
Monitor your staking performance:
```
Performance Dashboard:
- Initial Stake: 10,000 DI
- Current Value: 11,247 DI
- Time Staked: 156 days
- Annualized Return: 19.2%
- Governance Participation: 85%
- Voting Power Rank: #47
```

### Benchmarking
Compare against alternatives:
- Traditional savings accounts (2-3%)
- Government bonds (3-5%)
- Stock market returns (7-10%)
- Other DeFi protocols (5-15%)

### ROI Calculation
```
Total Return = (Current Value - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment

Example:
Current Value: 11,247 DI
Initial Investment: 10,000 DI
Total Return: (11,247 - 10,000) / 10,000 = 12.47%

Annualized: (1.1247)^(365/156) - 1 = 31.2%
```
