# Risk Management Guide

Master risk management techniques to protect your capital and maximize long-term success when trading on DI Network's platforms.

## Risk Management Fundamentals

### The 1% Rule
Never risk more than 1-2% of your total portfolio on a single trade:
```
Portfolio Size: $10,000
Maximum Risk per Trade: $100-200
Position Size Calculation: Risk Amount ÷ Stop Loss Distance
```

### Risk-Reward Ratio
Target minimum 2:1 risk-reward ratio:
```
Entry: $40,000
Stop Loss: $38,000 (Risk: $2,000)
Take Profit: $44,000 (Reward: $4,000)
Risk-Reward Ratio: 1:2 ✓
```

### Position Sizing Formula
```
Position Size = Account Risk ÷ (Entry Price - Stop Loss Price)

Example:
Account Risk: $200
Entry: $40,000
Stop Loss: $38,000
Position Size: $200 ÷ $2,000 = 0.1 units
```

## Spot Trading Risk Management

### Diversification Strategy
**Asset Class Allocation**:
- Crypto: 40%
- Commodities: 25%
- Equities: 25%
- Forex: 10%

**Individual Position Limits**:
- Maximum 10% in single asset
- Maximum 20% in single sector
- Rebalance monthly

### Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)
Reduce timing risk through systematic investing:
```
Weekly DCA Strategy:
Week 1: Buy $100 xBTC at $40,000
Week 2: Buy $100 xBTC at $38,000
Week 3: Buy $100 xBTC at $42,000
Average Cost: $40,000 (reduced volatility impact)
```

### Stop-Loss Strategies
**Percentage-Based Stops**:
- Conservative: 5-10% stop loss
- Moderate: 10-15% stop loss
- Aggressive: 15-20% stop loss

**Technical Stops**:
- Support/resistance levels
- Moving average breaks
- Trend line violations

## Perpetual Trading Risk Management

### Leverage Guidelines
**Beginner Levels**:
- Start with 2-3x leverage
- Never exceed 5x until experienced
- Understand liquidation mechanics

**Experience-Based Limits**:
| Experience | Max Leverage | Recommended |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Beginner   | 5x           | 2-3x        |
| Intermediate | 10x        | 3-5x        |
| Advanced   | 20x          | 5-10x       |
| Expert     | 50x          | 10-20x      |

### Liquidation Protection
**Health Factor Monitoring**:
```
Safe Zone: Health Factor > 2.0
Caution Zone: Health Factor 1.5-2.0
Danger Zone: Health Factor 1.2-1.5
Critical Zone: Health Factor < 1.2
```

**Liquidation Prevention**:
1. Monitor positions every 4-6 hours
2. Add collateral when health factor < 1.5
3. Reduce position size during high volatility
4. Use stop-losses before liquidation levels

### Funding Rate Management
**Funding Cost Calculation**:
```
Position Size: $10,000
Daily Funding Rate: 0.3%
Daily Cost: $30
Monthly Cost: $900 (significant for long-term holds)
```

**Funding Strategies**:
- Close positions before expensive funding
- Consider funding costs in profit targets
- Use funding arbitrage opportunities
- Monitor funding rate trends

## Portfolio Risk Management

### Correlation Analysis
Monitor correlation between positions:
```
High Correlation (>0.7): Reduce combined exposure
Medium Correlation (0.3-0.7): Normal allocation
Low Correlation (<0.3): Diversification benefit
```

### Maximum Drawdown Limits
Set portfolio-level stop losses:
- Conservative: 10% maximum drawdown
- Moderate: 15% maximum drawdown
- Aggressive: 20% maximum drawdown

### Risk Budgeting
Allocate risk across strategies:
```
Total Risk Budget: 100%
Spot Trading: 40%
Perpetual Trading: 30%
Arbitrage: 20%
Experimental: 10%
```

## Psychological Risk Management

### Emotional Control
**Common Emotional Traps**:
- FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)
- Revenge trading after losses
- Overconfidence after wins
- Analysis paralysis

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Stick to predetermined rules
- Take breaks after losses

- Keep a trading journal
